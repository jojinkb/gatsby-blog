These are my learning goals. This document will be updated regularly and is meant to be a snapshot of the current progress made on the goals stated below. The intention of writing this down in a public blog is to increase personal accountability.

## Read

This has the added benefit of contributing towards [my annual goodreads reading challenge](https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/49467895 "Jojin's 2024 goodreads reading challenge") (3/20)

The highest number of books I was able to track reading in a year is 20, I'm hoping to equal or surpass that number this year. Most of the books below have been on my to-read list for some time now. I might switch between categories or switch out titles to keep the keep the grey cells guessing. I've given myself some leeway on my reading list by having the option of walking away from the ones that don't interest me after a few chapters.

## Write
I'd like to get in the habit of writing regularly. I'll start by keeping notes about the books I read or projects that I'm working on.


Note: This blog post initially started off as my goals for 2021 ðŸ˜… but a lot of (good) things have happened to me in the last two years. Unfortunately, documenting and planning my learning took a backseat during this time. I've decided not to timebox this and track annual sub-goals separately since.
